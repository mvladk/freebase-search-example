# Freebase Search Example
A single page jQuery Web Application.

Example:
http://mvladk.github.io/freebase-search-example/index.html

As the user starts typing in words, the application should query Freebase (using [Search Service](http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/ApiSearch) ) and get various results.
Each result, then, should form a box on the page. Each box contains a title, a category, an image, some description about the result.
The client fetches description & image from [Freebase' Text](http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/ApiText) & [Image Services](http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/ApiImage).

For example, if I type Nirvana, then the various boxes might be telling me about the Belief, the Musical Group, the Movie, or maybe about Gautam Buddha. Essentially, this is a Freebase-based topic search engine. It'd be good if you can hyperlink these boxes to the topic on Freebase.

As the user starts typing more text, the application should wait for the user to stop typing. After some 400ms of stopped typing, the requests are to be sent to Freebase.

Optionally, you can arrange the results using [jQuery Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/).

## Development

All application specific code is under `coffeescript` directory. To develop agains this application, run `coffee -cw coffeescript` in your terminal. This will watch for changes and compile the `.coffee` files to `.js` files in the same directory.
